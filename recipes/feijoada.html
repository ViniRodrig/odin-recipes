        <h2><p>Description:</p></h2>
        <h3>
            <p>This is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent served over brown rice.</p>
        </h3>
        <h2><p>Ingredients:</p></h2>
        <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
            <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
            <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2><p>Steps:</p></h2>
        <h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup of chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in the soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
            <li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in smaller pot with 1/4 cup of the chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer, until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to the beans.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake 15 minutes or until mixture is crispy.</li>
            <li> Drain the bacon and ham mixture, and add to the beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered 30 minutes more. Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</li>
